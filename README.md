# AI-BASED-LICENCE-PLATE-IMAGE-SUPER-RESOLUTION-SYSTEM
To generate the best possible `README.md` for your GitHub project, I’ll first extract and review the contents of the uploaded zip file: `Ai-Based_Number_plate_image_super_resolution-main.zip`. Let's start by analyzing its structure and understanding the purpose of the project.

### 🔍 Initial Assumption (based on name):

Project likely uses deep learning for image super-resolution (enhancement) focused on **number plates**, which is commonly used in automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems.

Now I'll extract and inspect the files to generate an appropriate README.


Thanks! The project folder contains:

* ✅ A **Flask-based app** (`app.py`)
* ✅ Super-resolution model using **Real-ESRGAN**
* ✅ A full pipeline: image upload → number plate detection → super-resolution → storage in SQL database
* ✅ Assets like `templates/`, `static/`, `uploads/`, and a `README.md` from a subfolder

Now, I’ll create a **comprehensive and polished `README.md`** for the **top-level project**, summarizing all key components.

# 🚗 AI-Based Number Plate Image Super Resolution

This project enhances the quality of vehicle number plate images using **AI-based Super-Resolution** and integrates it into a complete web-based pipeline. Built using **Real-ESRGAN** and **Flask**, it also supports storing extracted license plate data in an SQL database.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Automatic Number Plate Detection
- 🧠 Super-Resolution using Real-ESRGAN
- 🗃️ Data storage in SQL database
- 🌐 Flask Web Interface for uploading and processing images
- 📊 Easy-to-read folder structure and extensible code

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Ai-Based_Number_plate_image_super_resolution.git
cd Ai-Based_Number_plate_image_super_resolution
````

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r License-Plate-Extraction-Save-Data-to-SQL-Database-main/requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Run the Flask App

```bash
cd License-Plate-Extraction-Save-Data-to-SQL-Database-main
python app.py
```

### Access the Web App

Open your browser and navigate to:
📍 `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

From here, you can:

* Upload images
* Extract and enhance number plates
* Save results into the database

## 🧠 Model Used

The core of the super-resolution functionality is based on **[Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)**, a powerful GAN-based model for image enhancement.
